You might think I would like this movie, given my love of sports and analytics, but I had a hard time caring about the Oakland Athletics or the main character. Not Brad Pitt again. That guy sure keeps busy. I suppose the movie is a fair rendering of a true story. After all, you can’t have the As winning the World Series when they didn’t. But I was left with an empty feeling at the end.  I think the story would have been better told from the point of view of the nerdy analyst. Give Jonah Hill more time in front of the camera and see what he can do. Maybe you could even work in a love interest. Some of my students asked me what I thought of the movie. I said it was OK.
