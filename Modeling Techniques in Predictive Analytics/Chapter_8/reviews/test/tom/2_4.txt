Joe Pesci and Marisa Tomei—now that’s an odd couple. The movie builds on stereotypes of Brooklyn and Alabama, and it’s hard to sympathize with the hapless cousin and his male friend.  Nor is there much suspense because we know what’s going to happen in the end. It has to work out. Tomei makes the hour or so go by just fine. Without the life she breathes into her fiancée role, this one would have been a waste.
