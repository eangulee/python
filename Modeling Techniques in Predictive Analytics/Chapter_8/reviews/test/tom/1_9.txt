Even better than Harrison Ford’s Raiders movies. This one is a keeper. Replicants with feeling—that’s a twist. The visual effects and fine photography draw you in. It’s like you are really there in the metropolis of the future. Not a pretty picture of what’s coming our way, but a great movie nonetheless.
